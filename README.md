# Research Social App

## Building and Running

`frontend` contains the frontend files
`backend` contains Node.js backend files
`db` is empty for now, but will contain files related to the PostgresQL database, including schema information.

To start the docker containers:

1. Run `docker-compose build`
2. Run `docker-compose up` to start the frontend and backend processes.
