# Project Structure

```plaintext
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/    # Contains React-based frontend
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/     # Node.js backend with Express
â”œâ”€â”€ db/          # PostgreSQL database schema and migration files (currently empty)
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml  # Docker configuration
```

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Installation & Running the Project

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/CMU-17-356/17-356-team-time.git](https://github.com/CMU-17-356/17-356-team-time.git)
```

### Build the Docker containers:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

### Start the application:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will launch both the frontend and the backend

### Access the application:

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:5000

_For troubleshooting, check the logs using:_

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

## Developer Guide

## Code Review Guidelines

### High Level Guidelines

#### 1. Purpose & Context

- Does the PR align with the project's goals?
- Are there alternative, simpler solutions that should be considered?
- Does the PR introduce unnecessary complexity?

ðŸ“Œ _Before reviewing, read the PR description, related issues, and design discussions._

#### 2. Code Architecture & Design

- Does the code follow existing patterns and conventions?
- Does the code introduce unnecessary dependencies?
- Are modules, classes, and functions reusable?

ðŸ“Œ _Favor modular, loosely coupled designs that improve maintainability._

#### 3. Maintainability & Readability

- Is the code easy to read/modify?
- Is there unnecessary complexity that could be simplified?
- Does the code have meaningful comments and documentation?

ðŸ“Œ _Clarity is key_

#### 4. Scalability & Performance

- Can this code handle increased load in the future?
- Are costly operations justified?

ðŸ“Œ _Consider the cost of technical debt quick fixes can slow down future development._

#### 5. Security & Compliance

- Does the code handle user input safely?
- Are authentication and authorization handled?
- Are dependencies up to date?

ðŸ“Œ _Review security with "worst-case scenario" in mind_

#### 6. Test Coverage & Reliability

- Are unit tests, integration tests, and edge cases covered when relevant?
- Are test cases meaningful?

ðŸ“Œ _Well tested code prevents future failure_

#### 7. Documentation & Communication

- Does the PR clearly explain what it does and why?
- Are future developers likely to struggle understanding this code?

ðŸ“Œ _A well-written PR provides crucial documentation for future development_

### Low Level Checklist for Code Structure and Readability

- [ ] Functions/methods/classes are named clearly and descriptively
- [ ] No dead code
- [ ] No outdated/unnecessary comments
- [ ] No magic numbers or hardcoded values that should be replaced with constants
- [ ] No excessive nesting that could be simplified
- [ ] Proper edge case handling
- [ ] No potential SQL injection risks
- [ ] Retries or fallbacks implemented where necessary
- [ ] Unit/integration tests cover the new changes
